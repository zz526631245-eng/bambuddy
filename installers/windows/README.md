# Bambuddy Windows Installer

> 本次正式空白版安装包会初始化一个全新的生产数据库，不导入开发机账号、产品、库存、打印机或虚拟测试数据。

Builds a self-contained Windows installer (`.exe`) for Bambuddy: embedded
Python 3.13 distribution + pre-built frontend + NSSM-supervised Windows
service. No Python or Node installation required on the target machine.

## Architecture

- **Install target:** `C:\Program Files\Bambuddy\`
- **Data target:** `C:\ProgramData\Bambuddy\data\` (preserved on uninstall by default)
- **Logs target:** `C:\ProgramData\Bambuddy\logs\`
- **Service:** registered via NSSM, runs as `LocalSystem`, autostart on boot
- **Service command:** `python.exe -m uvicorn backend.app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --loop asyncio` (`--loop asyncio` avoids a uvloop TLS bug that can truncate VP FTP uploads, #1896)
- **Bundled binaries:** Python 3.13 embeddable, NSSM, ffmpeg static build
- **Automatic slicing:** the installer includes the slicer compose definition
  and a separate visible **Install Docker and Slicer Services** channel in the
  Start Menu. The main Bambuddy install never waits on Docker or a large image
  download; run that channel after installation to see progress and retry
  safely if the network or WSL2 setup needs attention.
- **Production build:** `VITE_PRODUCTION_BUILD=1` hides the virtual-printer test entry; the service sets `BAMBUDDY_PRODUCTION_BUILD=1`.
- **First install:** `service\prepare-clean-data.bat` creates an empty data directory. An existing data directory is moved to `previous-data-<timestamp>` and is not loaded. The `.fresh-install-complete` marker prevents later upgrades from resetting production data.

Browser is the UI. Start Menu shortcut opens `http://localhost:8000`.

## Why these choices

See `memory/windows-installer-decision.md` for the full reasoning. Short
version: PowerShell install scripts can't survive environmental drift
across the Windows host fleet, so we ship a self-contained bundle that
depends on nothing on the host. Inno Setup + embedded Python is the
lowest-maintenance path that delivers native-app UX. No Tauri/Electron
launcher in v1 — browser-as-UI matches every other Bambuddy platform.

## Build prerequisites

The build runs on Windows (or in a Windows GitHub Actions runner). Cross-
building from Linux is possible via Wine but not officially supported.

- Windows 10/11 x64 (or `windows-latest` GitHub Actions runner)
- Python 3.11+ (for running `build.py`; the embedded Python that ships
  in the installer is downloaded fresh by the build script)
- Node.js 22 LTS + npm (for building the frontend bundle)
- [Inno Setup 6](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) (for compiling
  `bambuddy.iss` → `.exe`)

The build script downloads everything else automatically (embedded Python,
NSSM, ffmpeg). Docker Desktop and the slicer images are installed on the
target computer during the installer run because they are third-party
components and are not embedded inside the `.exe`.

## Build steps

```cmd
:: From the repo root on a Windows machine
cd installers\windows
python build.py
:: Then open bambuddy.iss in Inno Setup Compiler and click Build → Compile
:: (or invoke ISCC.exe directly:)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" bambuddy.iss
```

Output: `installers\windows\build\output\bambuddy-windows-setup.exe`

The current local build is `build\output\bambuddy-0.2.4.9-windows-x64-setup.exe`.

## Testing without signing

The installer can be built and run unsigned. Windows SmartScreen will
show "Windows protected your PC" on first run. Click **More info** →
**Run anyway** to proceed. This is expected and harmless for testing.
Production builds will be signed via SignPath OSS (application in
flight as of 2026-06-10) and won't show this warning after reputation
accrues.

## CI build

See `.github/workflows/windows-installer.yml` for the automated build.
The workflow runs on every tag matching `v*` and uploads the installer
as a release asset.

## Known limitations / open questions

- **VP feature on Windows:** the Virtual Printer needs to bind 322/990/8883
  (privileged ports). Service runs as LocalSystem which can bind these
  ports, but the user's Windows Firewall will prompt on first VP enable.
  Documenting this is TBD.
- **Spoolman:** explicitly NOT bundled in v1. Users who want Spoolman
  install it separately. Bambuddy internal-inventory mode is the default
  on Windows.
- **Slicer sidecar:** the Start Menu setup channel runs
  `service\install-slicer.bat`, which calls `setup-slicer.ps1` and uses the
  official Docker Desktop package (winget first, official download fallback),
  pulls the OrcaSlicer/BambuStudio API images, and starts them on ports 3003
  and 3001. The status is written to
  `C:\ProgramData\Bambuddy\slicer\setup-status.txt`; a Start Menu shortcut
  named **Install Docker and Slicer Services** can safely retry the setup. Docker Desktop
  may request one Windows restart or WSL2 initialization; the installer
  registers a RunOnce continuation so setup resumes after the next login.
  The compose stack and its data are kept on uninstall (containers are
  stopped, images/data are not deleted).
- **Bundle size:** estimated 250–350MB installed (mostly opencv +
  ffmpeg + matplotlib). Acceptable for a v1; can investigate slimming
  later if users complain.
- **Updates:** v1 ships as a fresh install / uninstall + install cycle.
  In-place upgrade via the same installer is supported by Inno Setup but
  needs end-to-end testing before we promise it.
