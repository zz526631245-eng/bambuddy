REM Register Bambuddy as a Windows service via NSSM.
REM
REM Called from Inno Setup's [Run] section. Arguments:
REM   %1 = install dir (e.g. C:\Program Files\Bambuddy)
REM   %2 = data dir   (e.g. C:\ProgramData\Bambuddy)
REM   %3 = port       (e.g. 8000)
REM
REM If the service already exists (re-install / upgrade), remove and
REM re-create it so config changes from this build apply.

REM Register the service. NSSM wraps uvicorn so Windows treats it as a
REM proper service (autostart, recovery, supervised restart).
REM --loop asyncio required: uvloop can truncate VP FTP uploads (#1896).

REM Environment: point DATA_DIR + LOG_DIR at ProgramData, prepend our
REM bin/ to PATH so ffmpeg/ffprobe are found by the shutil.which() lookup
REM in backend/app/services/layer_timelapse.py.
REM The installer starts these local sidecars before the app service, so keep
REM the URLs explicit and use IPv4 loopback for reliable Windows resolution.

REM Run as LocalSystem (default). Required for binding 322/990/8883 if
REM the user later enables the Virtual Printer feature. Most non-VP
REM workloads would work as a less-privileged account, but service
REM identity changes are disruptive — pick the broader one once.

REM Start the service. If it fails to start, NSSM exits non-zero and
REM Inno Setup will surface this to the user.
