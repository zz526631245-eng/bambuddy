# GHSA-r2qv-8222-hqg3 (CVSS 9.9) — API key permission enforcement is allowlist-based.
#
# Until 0.2.4.x, ``_check_apikey_permissions`` only consulted the admin denylist
# below. The three documented scope flags on ``APIKey``
# (``can_read_status`` / ``can_queue`` / ``can_control_printer`` / ``can_manage_library``)
# were enforced only by ``check_permission()`` inside ``routes/webhook.py``;
# every other route used ``require_permission_if_auth_enabled`` which fell
# through to the denylist-only path, so an API key with all flags unchecked
# could still stop prints, edit queue items, and read every endpoint not in
# this set. ``require_any_permission_if_auth_enabled`` and
# ``require_ownership_permission`` did not call this helper at all, so admin
# "any-of" routes and ownership-modify routes were entirely ungated for API keys.
#
# Fix: ``_check_apikey_permissions`` now requires every requested permission to
# be present in ``_APIKEY_SCOPE_BY_PERMISSION`` (allowlist), and gates on the
# corresponding scope flag on the API key. Unmapped permissions = 403. This
# means a Permission added to ``core/permissions.py`` without a matching entry
# in ``_APIKEY_SCOPE_BY_PERMISSION`` is automatically denied for API keys —
# the previous denylist shape allowed every new Permission to silently widen
# the API-key surface.
#
# The denylist is retained for documentation / drift-detection only — its
# entries also satisfy "not in the allowlist", so they fail closed regardless.
#
# Mapping rationale (see wiki/features/api-keys.md):
#   can_read_status       → every ``*_READ`` + camera + stats + system + websocket
#   can_queue             → queue write ops + archive reprint
#   can_control_printer   → physical printer + smart-plug control
#   can_manage_library    → library upload/own + MakerWorld import (separate
#                           trust level from queue management, hence its own flag)
#   can_manage_inventory  → spool/catalog/forecast writes + SpoolBuddy kiosk writes
#   can_manage_maintenance→ per-printer maintenance log/reset + type-catalog CRUD
#   admin-only            → unmapped (default-deny); covers all create/update/
#                           delete of admin resources, settings writes, user/
#                           group/api-key/backup admin ops, discovery scan,
#                           cloud auth, library ALL-ownership perms, purges
